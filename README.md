## Player's goal

Your goal is escaping form the cave. For escaping, you need to collect over 70 coins to open the gate.
There are 3 zombies moving around the cave so you need to avoid or defeat them by weapons(a combat knife and hand gun).
The knife can defeat the zombie permanently but the timing is really difficult to use whereas, the gun defeat the zombie temporary but easy to use. You have only three bullets.

## Built With

- Unity

## Future plans

The "store" button on the home page and "next level" buttons are not implemented at the moment. Hence In the future, I would like to implement multiple levels feature, the store funciton that user can purchase Items that help them and world rank feature that you can compete against other players.
